Instead of cramming it all into one function, you split up the work, creating one function that performs a single flip and a second function that uses your flip function to systematically generate all possible flips. And you tested it. How \"senior dev\" of you!"

    "The way we wrote it, `get_next_states` creates the whole list of possible next states even though we really only need to consider one of them at a time. It's not such a big deal here since even a stack with 20 pancakes can only be flipped 19 ways. A list of 19 lists isn't *that* much to hold in memory, but it is a little inefficient. And soon we'll have way too many things to keep in memory. So together, let's learn a new trick: turning your `get_next_states` function into a ***generator***."
